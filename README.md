## What is Internet Time?

What is "Swatch Internet Time"? Internet Time was dreamed up by Swatch in 1998. It's a  way to tell time, globally, without time zones. Every day is divided up into 1000 ".beats", starting from midnight BMT (GMT+1), running from @0 to @999.

In theory, this makes it easier to coordinate meeting times with people across the world: just tell them the .beat, and they can figure out the rest with something like dotBeat. For example, @42 is 4:00 PM in California, but it's 5:45 AM in Nepal.
